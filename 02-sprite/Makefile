# program ROM: your main program
# Add your dependencies below to compile your sources into an ELF binary
# that is used as the content of the program ROM (referenced by symbol PROM1)
# 
# Note: build rules (%.c -> %.o -> %.elf) are defined in Makefile.build

ELF=$(BUILDDIR)/rom.elf
$(ELF):	$(BUILDDIR)/main.o

# fixed tiles ROM: all your 8x8 pixel tiles for the fixed layer
# Add your dependencies below to convert images to fixed tile binary data
# and pack it into the fixed tile ROM (referenced by symbol SROM1)
# 
# By default, this makefile creates a tileset ROM with small and tall
# latin characters for printing ASCII string, and tiles that are
# displayed during the attract mode.
# Note: build rules (%.gif -> %.fix) are defined in Makefile.build
$(SROM1): $(BUILDDIR)/assets/base-srom-text-shadow.fix



# sprite ROM: all your 16x16 pixel tiles for sprites
# Add your dependencies below to convert images to fixed sprite binary data
# and pack it into two separate sprite ROMs that hold odd and even bits of
# color information (referenced by symbols CROM1 and CROM2)
#
# By default, this makefile creates CROMs with tiles for displaying a ngdevkit
# logo during the attract mode.
# Note: build rules (%.gif -> %.c<1,2>) are defined in Makefile.build

$(CROM2): $(BUILDDIR)/assets/logo.c2



# sound driver ROM: nullsound + your configured sound commands
# Add your dependencies below to compile your z80 sources into a HEX binary
# that is used as the sound driver ROM (referenced by symbol MROM1)
#
# By default, this makefile uses the empty sound driver provided by ngdevkit
# Note: build rules (%.s -> %.o -> %.ihx) are defined in Makefile.build
SOUND_DRIVER=$(NGSHAREDIR)/nullsound_driver.ihx
$(MROM1): $(SOUND_DRIVER)



# sound FX ROM: all your ADPCM samples
# Add your dependencies below to convert your samples into suitable
# ADPCM data and pack it into the sound ROM (referenced by symbol VROM1)
#
# Music and SFX assets can be managed with <> rather to generate
# the dependencies automatically.
# By default, no sample is used, so the VROM is empty
# Note: build rules (%.wav-> %.adpcm<a,b>) are defined in Makefile.build



# One-time asset preprocessing
# Various assets may have to be processed before they can be used to
# build your ROM, for example:
#   . the ngdevkit assets must be converted to sprite and text tiles
#   . converting your SFX assets from .mp3 into .wav so they can be
#     processed by ngdevkit tools
# To handle these pre-processing requirements, `make` automatically
# runs into all subdirectories under ./setup/, so you get a chance
# to preprocess what you need before anything is built.
#
# Other assets must be processed only once to generate source files
# that gets built into your ROM, for example:
#   . converting your musics from .fur to z80 code and data files
#   . generating make dependencies to pack gfx or sound assets into
#     the right ROM bank based on your input assets
# Those actions can be achieved by creating custom make targets
# that get invoked automatically when added to the variable below.
